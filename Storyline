The game starts with the main character, buttmunch, waking up in one of the upper turrets of a castle, 
with no memory of how he got there or even who he is, much less that his name is buttmunch.  
A purple trail of liquid leads him to a table shrouded in darkness near the edge of his otherwise 
featureless room.  Upon the table are two drinks--one red and one green, the first choice.

1: red and green drinks (go to 2 or 3).

2: drink the green and two doors appear, wood and wrought-iron. (go to 4 or 5).

3: drink the red and you convulse violently and structurally destabilize the castle turret 
(ik its stupid).  you either go for a rope or jump through the collapsing floor.  (go to 6 or 7).

4: the wood door leads down a spiral staircase.  you come to a door and can either enter or go further 
down. (go to 8 or 9)

5: the iron door closes behind you by itself, rather ominously.  you walk along a dimly lit hallway and 
see the outline of a sleeping beast.  you either sneak around or fight it.

6: you rope successfully outside of the castle, but fall 20 feet and lose blah hearts of health.  
there is a door at the other end of the courtyard or a path leading behind you.

7: you jump through the floor and luckily land in a decrepit fountain which cushions your fall.  
your foot knocks against something metallic in the water.  you either investigate or get the 
hell out of there.

8:
